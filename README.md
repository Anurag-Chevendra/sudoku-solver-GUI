# sudoku-solver-GUI

This is the updated version of my previous Sudoku solver . There are still a few loopholes and hence I am not merging this with the original "sudoku solver" code.

This updated program came into existence because i wanted to visualize the working of my algorithm and also because this makes the project 10 times more cool to even look at.

If you wish to understand the logic behind how this program works then [click here](https://github.com/Anurag-Chevendra/Sudoku-Solver).A brief explanation has been given so that you atleast develop an idea so as to what is happening.

The difficult part : Figuring out a way to avoid erasing of the entire screen (because the .clear() function exactly does that) when the program decides to backtrack and change it's decision.

Now coming to the drawbacks of this program : The GUI makes this program very slow and I have no idea how to resolve that issue . I have used the Turtle module of python .
